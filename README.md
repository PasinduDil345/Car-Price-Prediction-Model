### Used Car Price Prediction with Linear Regression

This project demonstrates how to build a linear regression model to predict the selling price of used cars. It covers the entire machine learning pipeline, from data cleaning and preprocessing to model training and evaluation.

* **Dataset**: The `car data.csv` file, with `Selling_Price` as the target variable for prediction.
* **Key Techniques & Concepts**:
    * **Model**: `LinearRegression`.
    * **Preprocessing**: One-hot encoding for categorical features, feature scaling using `StandardScaler`, and outlier removal.
    * **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Use of a correlation heatmap and distribution plots to understand the data.
    * **Evaluation**: Measuring model performance with RÂ² Score and Mean Squared Error (MSE).
* **Technologies Used**:
    * Python
    * Pandas
    * Scikit-learn
    * Matplotlib
    * Seaborn
